# pre-commit-hooks

My custom pre-commit hooks repository that stores the checks I use during
development. The goal of this project is to be a single, shared source of
opinionated pre-commit configs that can be used across various projects.

The name of one of the custom hooks written in Golang is `stinker` from the
phrase "hook line and s(t)inker", and to highlight code stinks.
